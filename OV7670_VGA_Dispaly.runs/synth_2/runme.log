These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/ov7670_top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/ov7670_top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/ov7670_top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [Constraints 18-5210] No constraints selected for write.
Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is opened.
