WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, clock_inst/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clk_125M 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'clock_inst/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.

Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/ov7670_top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
